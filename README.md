NER with RAG Chatbot
Overview
This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. 
The goal is to create a conversational agent that can understand and respond to user queries in a natural language, while accurately identifying and extracting entities from the input text.

Features
Named Entity Recognition: Uses advanced NLP models to identify and classify entities in user input.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines traditional information retrieval with generative models for enhanced responses.
Multi-Language Support: Capable of processing inputs in multiple languages.
Voice Recognition: Supports voice input for a more interactive user experience.
FAQ Database: Provides responses based on frequently asked questions to improve information retrieval.
Technologies Used
Python
SpaCy for NER
Hugging Face Transformers for RAG
Flask/Django for the web framework (if applicable)
Additional libraries: numpy, pandas, speech_recognition, etc.
